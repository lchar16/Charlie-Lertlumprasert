              Hi! My name is Charlie Lertlumprasert. I was born in Thailand, and moved to Northern Virginia when I was 9
              years old. I'm
              currently a senior at Virginia Tech, majoring in mechanical engineering and minoring in computer science.
              I'm
              passionate about making a positive impact on other people's lives, which is the reason I am on the
              Executive
              Board of the Student Engineers' Council, and worked as a Student Innovation Fellow at the
              Technology-Enhanced
              Learning and Online Strategies Center.
            </p>
            <p>
              One day I hope to work at the intersection of technology and sustainability, specifically in the food
              industry.
              But for now, my plan after graduation is to move out to Seattle to work as a Program Manager on the
              Microsoft365 Foundational Experiences Team.
            </p>
            <p>Health and fitness are huge parts of my life. After swimming competitively for 14 years, I got into
              weightlifting, then
              calisthenics, and now running. I love to cook and am on a (mostly) whole foods plant-based diet. In my
              free time, I enjoy
              playing guitar, singing, traveling, watching movies, and picking up new skills - like web
              development
              and video editing!
            </p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p>This lower-body gravity compensating exoskeleton will support 50 pounds of body weight per leg while
                  walking, climbing stairs, and performing basic, everyday activities. Our target customers are people
                  with physical, lower-body impairments, as well as first responders and industrial workers. Current
                  lower body exoskeletons are expensive, restrictive, stiff, and bulky. Our goals are to make the
                  exoskeleton lightweight, low profile, and comfortable by matching a natural gait cycle.
                </p>
                <p>The final design is a single-joint frame, single-motor actuation system, pictured below.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">My Contributions</h3>
                <p>I worked on the electronics and controls side of the project, which is the actuator system –
                  animation below!
                </p>
                <img class="img-fluid" height=400 width=500 src="img/portfolio/exoActuator.gif" alt="">
                <p>
                  The actuator system consists mainly of a motor and a spring. The gravity compensation comes from the
                  motor compressing the spring, which provides an upward force on the body. So, selecting a motor that
                  can provide enough torque and speed to mimic a natural gait cycle is very important and involves a lot
                  of calculations. A big factor in how much torque and speed the motor needs to provide is the spring’s
                  length and spring constant. Selecting the right combination of motor and spring can help minimize how
                  much the motor needs to travel, and therefore power consumption.
                </p>
                <h5>Spring and Motor Selection</h5>
                <p>To start off, we gathered from published gait studies joint angle data as a function of the gait
                  cycles for 4 movements: walking, ascending and descending stairs, and sitting to standing. These hip,
                  knee, and ankle angles, combined with anthropometric data, allowed us to create animations on MATLAB
                  of these movements. The walking animation of a person with a height in the 5th percentile is shown
                  below.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" height=300 width=300 src="img/portfolio/exoStickFigure.gif" alt="">
                <p>From these stick figure calculations, a map of the body’s position at every point in the gait cycle
                  can be obtained for all four modes of motion. Since the actuator will be attached on the upper thigh and
                  the upper shin, the distance between the upper thigh and the upper shin as a function of the gait
                  cycle can be calculated. With this information, along with ground reaction force (GRF) data, we can
                  determine the motor’s required position throughout the gait cycle.</p>
                <p>From the motor’s required position as a function of the gait cycle, we can also determine its
                  required velocity and acceleration. Then, the moment of inertia of the motor and screw system was
                  calculated to obtain the motor’s required torque. Finally, after plotting the speed and torque
                  requirements on a graph, we can find out what the motor’s power, no-load speed, and stall torque
                  should be! Here are the graphs I’m talking about.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" height=400 width=600 src="img/portfolio/exoMotorSpringSelection.PNG" alt="">
                <p>That was a super simplified, so if you are interested in a little more detail on the calculations,
                  <a href="docs/ExoMotorCalcs.pdf">
                    here is a document</a> that includes some derivations, as well as the MATLAB code.
                  And here is a
                  <a href="docs/ExoSpringComps.pdf">spring comparison document</a>.</p>
                <br></br>
                <h5>Electrical System</h5>
                <p>The electrical system consists of force sensors, distance sensors, spring potentiometer, battery,
                  knee angle encoders, ankle angle encoders, motors, motor encoders, an Arduino, an IMU, a buck
                  converter, and wires. The sensor selection process was mainly based on the information we knew about
                  the frame, which kept evolving. Ultimately, we needed to select sensors that could be mounted safely,
                  caused minimal protrusion, and that could be compatible with the microcontroller (5V or 3.3V input,
                  serial or analog communication, etc.). </p>
                <p>The most frustrating thing about sensors, is that they sometimes didn’t work the way we expected them
                  to. For example, the force sensors we originally picked were force resistive sensors. After ordering
                  them, waiting for them to ship, and testing, there just wasn’t a way to mount them on the footplate to
                  get accurate readings. So, we had to find different ones. </p>
                <p>Finally, after lots of testing and scouring the internet for sensors that fit our needs, here is the
                  final electrical schematic: </p>

                <br></br>
                <h5>Controls System</h5>
                <p>Below is the state machine that I made for the exoskeleton’s controls system. More details on the
                  methods, variables, and calculations can be found

                <p>The summit consisted of many workshops, like a public speaking workshop, teamworking workshop, etc.
                  The main challenge of the week was a case study, which was my first exposure to developing a holistic
                  solution to a problem with the big picture in mind. Up until this point, I had only been exposed to
                  technical problems and had never really thought about everything else that goes into creating a
                  product.
                  We considered everything from the target customer, value proposition, key performance metrics, costs,
                  projected revenues, and even the marketing campaign. This summit sparked my interest in becoming
                  a program manager. Our final presentation is attached below!

                <p>"Foundational Experience" are just fancy words for everything that is on the interface of the Windows
                  Operating System (OS):
                  the Taskbar, the Start Menu, File Explorer, etc. So, everything you see on Windows is what my team is

                <p>
                  To clear up any potential confusion, our "product" is the Windows OS, and the "features" are things

                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Project Overview</h3>
                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Again, because of NDA, I can't say much about what exactly I did here.
                  Here's a brief overview:</p>
                <p>My deliverable for the summer was a recommendation on whether or not we should add a new feature.
                  At the start of my internship, the feature was not yet defined. So, I was also in charge of "spec-ing"
                  it out:
                  what it would look like, where it would be in the product, what kind of content should be on it, and
                  what the user experience should look like.
                  I worked with a team of two software developers, a data scientist, a designer, and a user researcher.
                  To make this recommendation, there were two overarching
                  questions I needed to answer:
                </p>
                <ol align="left">
                  <li align="left">Will this new feature increase customer engagement and retention with the product?
                  </li>
                  <li align="left">Will it increase subscriptions to the product?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>To answer these questions, I needed to really understand our customers and how this new feature would
                  influence the way they use and feel about our product. This involved conducting user research
                  experiments
                  and using the results from those experiments to inform the design of the feature. I also needed to
                  make sure
                  that each design modification was technically feasible.
                </p>
                <p>The hardest part this process was orchestrating with the rest of the product team. I needed to make
                  sure that
                  every decision I made about this feature aligned with everyone else's feature goals and the product's
                  goals as a whole.
                  With such a large product team, I was constantly pulled in different directions and constantly
                  overwhelmed
                  with new information.
                </p>
                <p>Once I spec'd out the feature to a certain level of detail, it was time to figure out its business

                <p>I wrote service-layer threat detections for a new feature in Azure called Management Groups.</p>

                <p>TLDR: Management Groups are containers for subscriptions. It allows you to organize your

                  a hierachical tree structure in order to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance.</p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Project Overview</h3>
                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Because of NDA, I can't say much about what exactly I did here. Here's
                  a brief overview:</p>
                <p>With the added convenience of Management Groups comes a much broader attack surface. Management
                  Groups is
                  still in preview right now, and there are a lot of things that will change before it rolls out
                  publicly.
                  I worked with many different service teams to protect Management Groups, both from the prevention and
                  detection
                  sides.
                </p>
                <p>From the prevention side, I worked to integrate security features into the design of Management
                  Groups. With
                  the help of Azure Red Team engineers, I identified vulnerabilities in the current version of the
                  feature
                  and worked with the feature team to write threat protection plans and specifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the detection side, I worked with the Identity Machine Learning team on writing cross-service
                  detections for the feature.
                  The main goal was to identify the hundreds, or even thousands, of attack scenarios in order to send
                  security
                  analysts alerts with a high signal-to-noise ratio.

                <p class="item-intro text-muted"> The Student Engineers' Council (SEC) at Virginia Tech is an umbrella
                  organization devoted to serving the
                  University's College of Engineering. We help foster a professional network for students by organizing
                  events
                  such as E-Week, Engineering Exposition, and the Leadership in Engineering Conference.
                  The Engineering Exposition is one of the largest student-run career fairs in the country, bringing in
                  300+ companies, 6,000+ student attendees, and $500,000+ in revenue. With the profit from Expo, we're
                  able to put on our other events and grant over $160,000 per year to design teams,
                  engineering organizations, and faculty.

                <p>For our National Conference, I edited this video to submit as part of our Best Overall Large Council
                  application.
                  My goal was to summarize all the work that we do.</p>

                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Vice President</h3>
                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Date: March 2019 - Present</p>
                <p>
                  As Vice President, my responsibilities are to serve as a mentor to the 12 chairs and directors on the
                  executive board. My job is to make sure that everyone is meeting the goals they've set for themselves,
                  and to make sure that those goals align with SEC's mission and vision. I work with the President to
                  outline that mission and vision and come up with 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year plans for the SEC.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To me, an important part of being a mentor is having personal relationships with each member of the
                  board.
                  So, a tradition I've started during my term is semesterly one-on-one meetings with each member. This
                  has been
                  one of the most rewarding things I've done during my time on the SEC. I feel that through these
                  meetings, I've
                  been able to facilitate the growth of our members. For example, the Awards and Scholarships chair
                  shared new
                  award ideas that she was too shy to share during board meetings with me, and I was able to help those
                  ideas come
                  to fruition. Additionally, the Director of Philanthropy voiced to me some concerns he had about our
                  funding process, and I was
                  able to help transform our process to be more fair towards organizations and inclusive towards our
                  members. Lastly,
                  the Membership Enrichment Chair told me that she felt like her voice wasn't heard during board
                  meetings, and
                  I was able to help direct more attention towards her during meetings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond typical Vice President responsibilities, I want to do one last thing for the College of
                  Engineering that hits close to home.
                  Having seen my older sisters work part time all throughout college to fund their education, I was
                  overwhelmed
                  with gratitude for my scholarship. Without my scholarship, I simply would not have been able to afford
                  my
                  academic performance, my involvement in the SEC and Technology-enhanced Learning and Online
                  Strategies (TLOS), and the time I have dedicated to countless other pursuits. I’ve never lost sight of
                  how
                  privileged I am to have been given this level of support and opportunity, and it would mean the world
                  to me
                  if I could make this type of impact on someone else’s life. Therefore, I’m working to repurpose one of
                  the
                  SEC’s endowments to give 3 full scholarships to low-income and minority engineering students.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The President, Director of Finance, and I are also working with Virginia Tech's Associate Dean of
                  Administration
                  and Chief of Staff on contributing SEC funds to a "maker space" accessible to all undergraduate
                  students. This has been
                  a stretch goal of ours for a couple of years, and I'm really excited that we're finally starting
                  conversations about
                  the possibility of this maker space. Virginia Tech currently does not have an engineering lab
                  accessible to all students,
                  with equipment like 3D printers, laser cutters, drill presses, and CNC machines. The goal of this
                  space is to
                  make those equipments available to everyone, to facilitate more hands-on learning through personal
                  projects.

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Date: May 2018 - March 2019</p>
                <p>As Director of Finance (DOF), I was in charge of managing finances for the organization: day-to-day
                  operation
                  costs and income, philantropy efforts, and endowments totaling over $1 million. I created and
                  administered
                  the organization's annual budget, as well as consult with accountants and financial professionals to
                  file
                  taxes, manage investments, and maintain our status as a 501(c)(3) non profit organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond typical responsibilities of the DOF above, I was able to make a difference of my own during my
                  term.
                  I led the SEC in fully endowing the Lynn Nystrom Engineering Organization Fund of $1,000,000 two
                  years ahead of schedule; the fund was started in 2011 and was scheduled to be fully endowed in 2021.
                  This fund is now being awarded to undergraduate students presenting their research at educational
                  conferences, to help finance their travel expenses. In the same term, I also led the SEC in fully
                  endowing the Humanitarian Endowment of $120,000 one year ahead of schedule. This fund is now being
                  awarded to students and faculty involved in educational activities related to international
                  humanitarian projects.

                <p>
                  At the beginning of the semester, I promised my boss and my mechanical design professor that I would
                  build an augmented reality app that helps teach stress analysis concepts – with no AR development
                  experience. In many mechanical engineering classes, we learn about a lot of abstract concepts, and
                  I’ve always thought AR would allow students to interact with the material in a more concrete way. I
                  was excited to combine and apply my two areas of study to help students gain a deeper understanding of
                  mechanical design. I was terrified, though, that I wouldn’t be able to deliver what I promised due
                  to lack of experience, especially because I was the only person working on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I had to learn a new language, C#, a new tool, Unity, and a new modeling software, Maya. I sought out
                  every resource I could think of – YouTube, Unity website, friends of friends of friends, faculty,
                  professors. By the end of the semester, I built an app that recognizes figures, brings
                  up their corresponding 3D model, and animates in a way that real structures would deform under the
                  given forces and moments, among other features that illustrate stress analysis concepts (video
                  below!).
                  My classmates have said they wished they had this app earlier, and my professor is enthusiastic about
                  using the app in her class!

                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="" alt="">
                <p>I worked under the Lean Leader, so all of my projects were process improvement efforts in order to
                  drive
                  up productivity. I was not allowed to take pictures, so all the text might be a little boring.</p>
                <ol align="left">
                  <li align="left">Redesigned mobile units to enhance visual management and expedite assembly process
                    for Dash 8 propeller
                    parts.
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The repair and overhaul process for propeller part involves disassembly of the part, putting all
                      the
                      pieces in a cart, and sending them through 4 different "gates" responsible for each step of the
                      process.
                      Because there are so many types of screws, bolts, and other small parts to keep track of, some
                      inevitably
                      would get mixed up or lost - decreasing productivity. In addition, at peak times, carts would
                      overcrowd
                      the working area, making it difficult to maneuver through the shop. I studied our shop workers at
                      each
                      gate to see how they interacted with the carts and used the information I gathered to design a new
                      cart with shadow boards that mimicked the exploded view of a CAD model. This way, as the propeller
                      part moved from tear-down, inspection, to assembly, there was a designated place for every piece.
                      This
                      standardization made the layout more intuitive, reduced the chances of lost/misplaced parts, cut
                      down
                      the square footage of the cart by 50%, and therefore increased productivity.

                  <li align="left">Used Lean Principles and 5S to manage local storage to prevent material shortages.
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>During my first week of the internship, my mentor showed me the local storage in disarray, gave
                      me a
                      booklet on lean principles, and told me to implement a self sustaining system to organize it. This
                      turned out to be the hardest project of the whole summer because it needed the cooperation of
                      everyone
                      on the shop. Because the LS wasn't organized well, shop workers spent a long time looking for some
                      materials. Sometimes, we ran out of important materials, but no one knew to order more; sometimes,
                      we had materials in stock, but people would order more because they couldn't find them, which
                      resulted
                      in old materials going to waste and shop workers waiting days for new materials to arrive. After
                      reorganizing
                      LS by applying all of the things I learned from that booklet, I implemented a new system that held
                      everyone accountable for keeping LS neat and reporting any time we need to order new materials. To
                      take it a step further, I made an interactive tutorial video with the help of shop workers. By
                      doing
                      this, I built relationships with people on the shop, which helped in implementing the new system.
                      I
                      showed the tutorial to everyone in the shop and checked LS every single morning. If I saw that
                      something
                      was done wrong, I tracked down the person to show them the right way. By the end of my 3 months,
                      the
                      shop workers rarely made any mistakes. This allowed everyone to be more productive because they no
                      longer spent time looking for materials they needed and there were no more material shortages.

                      Creative Wednesdays: every Wednesday, I led a 30-minute brainstorming session with workers in the
                      Blade Room to come up with
                      new ways to improve turnaround times. Many ideas were brought to life, such as creating a toolbox
                      attached
                      to the workers' chairs, changing types of sand paper, and using a heat gun to help remove blade

                      As part of process improvement efforts, I was tracking how much time each worker spent at each
                      step of the repair and overhaul
                      process. Workers signed in to a job by scanning their badges at the start and finish of each job.
                      Each
                      day, the Operations Manager spent at least an hour to walk the shop and manually check where which
                      blade and hub are in the repair or overhaul process in order to evaluate whether or not the
                      products
                      would be shipped back to the customer on time. I leveraged the information I was already tracking
                      in
                      order to create a digital chart, using Excel, of where every single blade in the shop was. It
                      featured
                      conditional highlighting of WO numbers that were not on track to ship on time. In addition, it
                      automatically
                      updated at the end of each work day. The Operations Manager no longer had to spend more than an
                      hour
                      every morning and could get all the information she needed with a quick look at the chart I made.

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Again, because of NDA, I'll just give a brief overview of what I worked
                  on.</p>
                <p>My goal was to develop a new method to study platinum catalysts using the nuclear magnetic resonance
                  (NMR)
                  technique. Nuclear magnetic resonance is an analytical tool that tells us about the structure of
                  molecules.
                  By performing experiments with the nuclei of atoms, the chemical environment of the nuclei can be
                  determined
                  from the data collected.</p>
                <p>Since the NMR spectroscopy is used to determine the chemical environment of nuclei, it can be used to
                  study
                  how molecules interact with each other in a chemical reaction. Platinum catalysts are used for
                  industrial
                  purposes, such as autocatalysts and fuel cell technologies. However, platinum has a very broad
                  lineshape,
                  which means that there is a very wide range of frequencies that can excite platinum nuclei. A single
                  experiment
                  does not allow us to see platinum’s whole line. Consequently, we cannot determine the active
                  structural
                  features and optimize its use. To be able to see its whole line, we can vary the external magnetic
                  field.
                  Since we can only see a small section of its line, varying the external magnetic field will allow us
                  to
                  see different sections of the line, and we can then put together the pieces!

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Project Overview</h3>
                <p>Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are self-powered robots which peruse waters independently and
                  are capable
                  of completing their surveyed missions without operator intervention. Underwater Gliders are a
                  sub-class
                  of AUVs, which operate by manipulating buoyancy, the tendency of objects to float in fluids, through
                  varied
                  models of internal actuators. The gliders in our experiment use internal tanks and pumps fashioned
                  from
                  syringes in conjunction with a set of external wings and a tail to dictate pitch (angle of
                  ascent/descent)
                  and direction.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/glider-bouyancy.jpg" alt="">
                <p> Gliders move on a saw-tooth pattern, gliding downwards when their internal fluid volume is denser
                  than surrounding
                  waters, and upwards when their internal fluid volume is less dense than surrounding waters. Gliders’
                  ability
                  to survey shallower waters than boats, and deeper waters than human divers or tethered vehicles can
                  make
                  AUVs are attractive options for oceanographic research. Underwater gliders are ideal due to their low
                  cost,
                  and low-power yet high endurance nature. Additionally, gliders have significantly greater range
                  (hundreds
                  or thousands of kilometers) and mission duration (weeks to months) than AUVs propelled by electric
                  motors.
                  Gliders can be outfitted with oceanographic sensors to measure various variables of the ocean. This
                  data
                  can provide scientists with information about ocean processes, like mixing; meteorologists with
                  information
                  about weather events, such as hurricanes; managers and business supervisors with information about
                  water
                  quality; and climate modelers with information regarding changes in the water over time.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">My Contributions</h3>

                <p>I was in charge of the glider hull design and construction.
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/hull.jpg" alt=""> Our glider is 30 inches
                  long, 4 inches in diameter, and 22 inches in wingspan. The shape of our glider
                  is inspired by a study by Parsons and Goodsons from Purdue University. The shape is called X-35 and is
                  designed to be streamlined and low drag. Our glider is a somewhat elongated version of that shape. It
                  has
                  one-third of the drag of a regular torpedo shape, which is extremely efficient. In addition, it has
                  adjustable
                  wings to control the center of gravity, and consequently the angle of the dive. The farther the wing
                  is
                  from the center of gravity, the steeper the angle of descent and ascent. Although the wings were
                  commercially
                  bought from surfboard fins, it is extremely efficient. The winglets on the wings capture the lost
                  vorticity
                  and converts it to energy, which help reduce drag.
                  <br></br>
                  Our whole design was 3D printed. It took 100 hours to print the middle section and 40-50 hours to
                  print the front and back
                  section each. Our current design is printed with polylactic acid (PLA). However, PLA is not strong
                  enough
                  for our actual application. It is biodegradable, has a lower melting temperature, and is more rigid,
                  making
                  it harder for assembly. If PLA sits too long in the sun, it has a tendency to melt, which is not ideal
                  for collecting data in coastal waters. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) would be more suitable
                  for
                  our goals. ABS is stronger, more flexible, and has a higher temperature resistance, and is not harmful
                  to the environment.
                  <br></br>
                  An important part of building this glider was waterproofing it so that the insides do not flood with
                  water and short the
                  circuits. We waterproofed our glider based on a proven design by National Geographic using o-rings and
                  screws. At the end of the nosecone and the backend of the glider, there are two grooves and series of
                  screw
                  holes. The o-rings are placed in the grooves and provide a tight fit when placed into the back half.
                  The
                  screws are used to add extra security to the whole design and hold everything in place. When the
                  assembly
                  experiences pressure, the outside pressure tends to crush the middle of the tube. When the center of
                  the
                  tube crushes, the screws outside the o-rings keep the tube from pulling away from the o-rings and
                  breaking
                  the seals, and consequently flooding the contents. Additionally, the middle section has stiffening
                  rods
                  and fin supports to further resist crushing by pressure. As the glider goes deeper underwater, the
                  pressure
                  increases one atmosphere for every 10 meters of depth. For our applications, the glider will go as
                  deep
                  as 200 feet, in which the pressure will be 20 times greater than the pressure at sea level.
